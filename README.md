# Image-processing-app
This project aims to create a basic image processing app using Python. The app will allow users to modify and manipulate images by implementing different image processing methods. The project is divided into five parts:

# Part 1: Image Storage

In this part, we will cover how images are stored in code and implement this in a Python class. Images are stored as 3-dimensional matrices with height, width, and channel dimensions. Each pixel is represented as a triplet (R, G, B), where R, G, and B are integer values between 0 and 255. We will create a Python class to represent images and define methods to read, write and manipulate images.

# Part 2: Image Processing

In this part, we will implement some basic image processing methods to modify input images. We will implement methods to resize, rotate, flip, and crop images. We will also implement methods to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color balance of images.

# Part 3: Monetized App

In this part, we will use classes to create a monetized app using the image processing methods from Part 2. The app will allow users to upload images, modify them using the implemented methods, and save the modified images. We will also implement a payment system to monetize the app.

# Part 4: Premium Version

In this part, we will create a premium version of the app with new and advanced image processing methods. We will implement methods for object detection, edge detection, and image segmentation. The premium version will also have additional features such as image filters and effects.

# Part 5: Image Classification

In this part, we will implement a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier to predict the labels of images. We will train the classifier on a dataset of labeled images and use it to classify new images uploaded by the user.

# Overall, this project will provide a good understanding of how images are stored and processed in code. It will also help in developing programming skills in Python and working with classes and methods. The final product will be an image processing app that can be used for basic image manipulations and advanced image analysis.
